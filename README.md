# Apache Virtual Hosts Creator
A simple python code that can automate the process of creating a virtual host onto your Linux dist. 
note that i have tested this only on Ubuntu and Ubuntu based distros and i am not concern about redhat and redhat based distros other than Ubuntu, if it helps and if you know how to make it work for the distros other than Ubuntu then please feel free to contribute few lines of code here :) 

***happy coding***

# Installing avhCreator.py
before we start make sure you have Apache configured in your local development platform.

## 1. lets put the avhCreator.py into a directory

**Open the terminal and lets start.**

*go to the home directory*

    cd home/

create a folder named "avhCreator"

    sudo mkdir avhCreator
*enter into the folder*

    cd avhCreator/

Download avhCreator.py

    sudo curl -o avhCreator.py  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tanhongit/Apache-Virtual-Hosts-Creator/master/avhCreator.py

## 2. time to play/run the script, can't wait

    sudo python avhCreator.py

time to talk ;) the script itself is really descriptive so you should get the idea what to do when, if not you can make it better by contributing your code.
